# ðŸŽ¤ Voice Clone - Web App

## Project Overview
Voice Clone is a web application that allows users to generate audio files by cloning their own voice. Users can upload a MP3 voice sample and enter the text they want to convert into audio. The application lets users customize settings such as speed, stability, similarity, and style to finely tune the output audio files.

## Installation
To set up the Voice Clone web app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd voice_clone_web_app
   ```
2. Open the `voice_clone_web_app.html` file in a web browser. There is no backend server required; the application is entirely frontend.

## Usage
1. **Upload MP3 Voice Sample**: Click the upload area to select or drag & drop your MP3 or WAV voice sample.
2. **Enter Text**: Fill in the text input area with the text you want to convert into audio files. Each line will create a separate audio file.
3. **Adjust Voice Settings**: Use the sliders to modify settings for speed, stability, similarity, and style.
4. **Generate Voice Clone**: Click on the "Generate Voice Clone" button to create audio files based on your text input.
5. **Download Generated Files**: You can download individual audio files or all at once.

## Features
- Upload MP3/WAV files for voice cloning.
- Input multiple lines of text, generating separate audio files for each line.
- Adjustable settings for voice cloning: speed, stability, similarity, and style.
- Preview generated audio files inline with option to download.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop usage.
